# Business Analytics III

A collection of course projects, notebooks and dashboards for Business Analytics III. This repository demonstrates practical end-to-end analytics workflows — from data cleaning and exploratory analysis to interactive dashboards and predictive models — using Excel, Power BI, Tableau, Python (pandas, scikit-learn), SQL, Stata, and deep learning frameworks (PyTorch / TensorFlow).

## Overview
This repo gathers assignments and portfolio pieces completed for Business Analytics III. Each project contains data, reproducible analysis (Jupyter notebooks / scripts), and final deliverables (reports, Power BI/Tableau dashboards). The goal is to showcase applied data analytics skills for business decision making.

## Projects (examples)
- Sales Forecasting — time-series and regression models to forecast monthly sales; includes feature engineering and model evaluation.
- Customer Segmentation — clustering and profiling of customers using RFM and unsupervised methods.
- Marketing Campaign Analysis — A/B analysis and uplift modeling to measure campaign effectiveness.
- Dashboarding & Reporting — interactive Power BI and Tableau dashboards that summarize KPIs and trends.
- Machine Learning Experiment — classification pipeline using scikit-learn; optional deep learning experiments with PyTorch/TensorFlow.
- Predicting Yearling Horse Auction Pricing (Senior Project) — Performed EDA and cross-validation on 6,000+ auction records; identified sire reputation as the top price driver and trained Ridge/Lasso regressions explaining ~55% of variance on log(price). Deployed a Streamlit app to provide real-time valuations for non-technical stakeholders.

## Technologies
Excel (advanced), Power BI, Tableau, Python (pandas, scikit-learn), SQL, Stata, Git, EndNote, Linux, PyTorch, TensorFlow
